# PointTinyBenchmark

--------------

PointTinyBenchmark is an open source toolbox for object localization and detection tasks on top of [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 

To date, It implements the following benchmark and algorithms:

* [Scale Match for TinyPerson Detection (WACV2020)](TOV_mmdetection/docs/tov/)
* [Object Localization under Single Coarse Point Supervision (CVPR2022)](TOV_mmdetection/docs/cpr)
